It is also worth noting how many frequency spikes are occupied by the \"Unknown\" molecule.  This could be a single molecule, but more  likely a combination of several for which data just isn't available yet.  The probable molecules are those whose weight (intensity $\\times$ flux) are a maximum for a particular frequency.
