This location hosts time series analyses performed during my Master's Degree at SMU, as well as analyses I have performed on my own.

This includes code I have written from lectures and used in homeworks.

The main analyses here are my Final Project and it is the R markdown file. 
The presentation goes along with it and includes a link to my live presentation.
